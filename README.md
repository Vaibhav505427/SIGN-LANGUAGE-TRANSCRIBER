**Description:**

The Sign Language Transcriber is a Python-based project designed to bridge the communication gap between individuals who use sign language and those who do not. This application leverages computer vision and deep learning techniques to recognize and translate hand gestures into textual or spoken language in real time.

Key Features:

Real-Time Gesture Recognition:
Uses a webcam or camera feed to detect and interpret sign language gestures.

Deep Learning Model Integration:
Employs pretrained neural networks (e.g., CNNs, RNNs, or transformers) for accurate recognition of signs.

User-Friendly Interface:
A graphical or command-line interface displays recognized signs and provides the corresponding translation in text or speech.

Language Support:
Supports multiple languages, allowing users to customize output text to suit their preferences.

Custom Gesture Training:
Enables users to train the model for new or personalized gestures to enhance functionality and adaptability.

Offline and Online Modes:
Offers an offline mode for environments without internet connectivity and an online mode for accessing cloud-based processing.

Feedback Mechanism:
Allows users to provide feedback on incorrect translations to continuously improve the modelâ€™s accuracy. Users can flag errors, suggest corrections, or provide labeled data to retrain the system. This iterative process ensures the transcriber evolves to better understand complex gestures, regional variations, and user-specific needs over time.
